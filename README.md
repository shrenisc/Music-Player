# Music-Player
This repository consists of a fully functional music player that can search, sort, add and delete songs
Much like Spotify, the pre-existing music library is fed into the music player. Users can perform the following functions:
        1. View songs in the library along with Song Artist and Duration
        2. Add songs from library to the queue
        3. Add songs from library to the playlist
        4. View songs in the queue, sort or remove songs from the queue
        5. View songs in the playlist, sort or remove songs in playlist, and also add them to queue from playlist.
